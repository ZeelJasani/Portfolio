## Book Implementation Details

The book is implemented using Three.js SkinnedMesh for smooth page animations. Key implementation details:

### Page Geometry
- **Width:** 1.28 units
- **Height:** 1.71 units (4:3 aspect ratio)
- **Depth:** 0.003 units

### Animation Parameters
- Page turning speed controlled by easing functions
- Customizable curve strength for natural page bending
- Physics-based page folding simulation

### Materials
- Realistic paper texture mapping
- Dynamic shadow casting
- Custom shaders for page edges and surface details

## Customization

### Changing Book Content
- Add/update page textures in `public/textures/`
- Modify the pages array in `UI.jsx` to update content

### Adjusting 3D Parameters
Edit the following files for specific customizations:
- **Book.jsx:** Page dimensions, animation parameters
- **Experience.jsx:** Lighting, camera position, environment
- **UI.jsx:** Content and navigation controls
