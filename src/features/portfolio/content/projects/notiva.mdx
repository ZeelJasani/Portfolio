title: Notiva - The Cognitive Code Taking Environment
description: A high-performance, block-based note-taking platform architected for the modern developer.
---

Notiva isn't just a note-taking app; it's a cognitive workspace designed to mirror the way developers think. Built with the latest Next.js 15 App Router and a custom Tiptap-based block editor, it offers a seamless blend of structured organization and free-form creativity.

### Why Notiva?

As developers, our thoughts are often hierarchical and syntactically rich. Notiva bridges the gap between the rigid structure of a file system and the flexibility of a blank page, providing a keyboard-first experience that never breaks your flow.

## Premium Features

### Keyboard-Centric Block Editor

Built on top of **Tiptap**, the editor is the heart of Notiva. It's not just text; it's a collection of interactive blocks.

* **Slash Commands (`/`)**: Instantly trigger formatting, media embeds, or custom components without lifting your hands from the keyboard.
* **Intelligent Code Blocks**: Native syntax highlighting for 50+ languages using `lowlight` and `highlight.js`, with automatic language detection.
* **Markdown Support**: True markdown-friendly input patterns (e.g., `#` for headings, `*` for lists).

### Nested Data Architecture

Organize your knowledge with an infinite hierarchy of notebooks and notes.

* **Recursive Sidebar**: A custom-built, server-side rendered sidebar that handles deep nesting with ease and high performance.
* **Real-time Persistence**: Leverages **Drizzle ORM** and **Neon** for optimistic updates and ultra-low latency data synchronization.

### Secure & Scalable Authentication

Integrated with **Better Auth** to provide enterprise-grade security:

* Social Logins (Google, GitHub).
* Secure Session Management.
* Fine-grained Authorization.

### Adaptive & Premium UI

A design language that feels alive.

* **Glassmorphism Effects**: Subtle blurs and gradients powered by Tailwind CSS 4.
* **Micro-interactions**: Smooth transitions and animations using **Framer Motion**.
* **Dynamic Theme Engine**: Perfect harmony between Dark and Light modes.
