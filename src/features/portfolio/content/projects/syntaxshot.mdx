## Technical Accomplishments

**State Persistence & Fluidity**

*Challenge:* Managing dozens of independent customization settings (colors, padding, themes, fonts) without degrading performance or losing user state.

*Implementation:* Utilized Zustand with persistent middleware to ensure the user's studio preferences are saved locally. Implemented optimized re-renders so that changing a single property like "roundness" feels instantaneous even with complex code highlighting active.

**Canvas Rendering Accuracy**

*Challenge:* Ensuring that the complex CSS-based mockup translates perfectly to an exported image format.

*Implementation:* Engineered a layered rendering system where the browser frame, window controls, and code block are treated as independent CSS-modular components. This approach ensures consistent layout regardless of the aspect ratio or resolution of the final export.
