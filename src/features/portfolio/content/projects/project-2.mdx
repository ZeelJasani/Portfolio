# Task Management App

A collaborative task management application designed for teams to work together efficiently with real-time synchronization.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Synchronization**: Tasks update instantly across all devices and team members.
- **Multi-user Support**: Role-based permissions for different team members.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive task organization with visual feedback.
- **File Attachments**: Share documents and files directly within tasks.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Stay updated with instant alerts for task changes.

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Socket.io

## Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was implementing real-time synchronization without overwhelming the server. We solved this by using Socket.io's room-based architecture and implementing efficient data diffing to only send changed data to clients.

## Outcome

Successfully deployed application handling 100+ concurrent users with sub-second update latency.
