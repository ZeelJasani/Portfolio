  about: `
I'm a **Software Developer** who enjoys building things that feel useful, smooth, and meaningful. I love working on web applications, mobile apps, and anything that allows me to turn an idea into something people can actually use.

I work across the **full stack**, and I enjoy both sides of development creating clean, intuitive interfaces and designing backend systems that are stable, secure, and scalable. Solving real problems through code is something that genuinely motivates me, and I'm always learning, experimenting, and improving my approach.

I'm also exploring **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, trying to understand how intelligent systems can make everyday products smarter and more impactful. My long-term goal is to grow into a well-rounded engineer who can build complete solutions, from web to mobile, while integrating modern AI wherever it makes sense.

I'm open to **internships**, **collaborations**, **freelance opportunities**, and anything that helps me grow, learn, and build better products.
