  // Hello, World! I am Chánh Đại — a Design Engineer passionate about creating high-performance, user-centric software solutions with intuitive and engaging designs.

  // With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building high-quality web and mobile applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Beyond work, I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into reality through personal projects.

  // One of my key projects, [ZaDark](https://zadark.com), launched in 2022, enhances the Zalo experience on PC and Web, surpassing 80k+ downloads on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zadark) and reaching 20k+ active users on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/llfhpkkeljlgnjgkholeppfnepmjppob) (as of Sep 2025).

  // I'm also the creator of [React Wheel Picker](https://react-wheel-picker.chanhdai.com) — iOS-like wheel picker for React with smooth inertia scrolling and infinite loop support. It has earned 4k+ weekly downloads on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ncdai/react-wheel-picker) and was selected for [▲Vercel OSS Program](https://vercel.com/blog/summer-2025-oss-program#react-wheel-picker) summer 2025 cohort.

  // Let's connect and collaborate!

  about: `
I'm a **Software Developer** who enjoys building things that feel useful, smooth, and meaningful. I love working on web applications, mobile apps, and anything that allows me to turn an idea into something people can actually use.

I work across the **full stack**, and I enjoy both sides of development creating clean, intuitive interfaces and designing backend systems that are stable, secure, and scalable. Solving real problems through code is something that genuinely motivates me, and I'm always learning, experimenting, and improving my approach.

I'm also exploring **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, trying to understand how intelligent systems can make everyday products smarter and more impactful. My long-term goal is to grow into a well-rounded engineer who can build complete solutions, from web to mobile, while integrating modern AI wherever it makes sense.

I'm open to **internships**, **collaborations**, **freelance opportunities**, and anything that helps me grow, learn, and build better products.
